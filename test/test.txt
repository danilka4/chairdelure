<@996498411782152272> (sorry for the late ping) i want to switch from MEng to MS and over the semester you told me it‚Äôd be best to obtain a sponsor/advisor before applying for the switch. due to various circumstances (primarily cs 3214) i didn‚Äôt have time to do it over the semester. would i still have time to switch over if i sent emails to potential faculty members over winter break/early spring semester?
"I see that PSCI 5554 is not listed under the ""Approved Cognate Courses"" list, will it be added there at some point?"
"never mind just looked through previous emails and saw i submitted force add requests, i will get onto that üòÖ"
"yes, although you probably won‚Äôt be able to force add it again"
by next spring i meant spring ‚Äò23 if that makes a difference
"1. It‚Äôll be next spring
2. Sounds good to me, I‚Äôll forward that to my professor"
"Thank you! I have a couple follow up questions since I‚Äôm in the accelerated program:
I‚Äôll have to add the course to the list of classes I‚Äôll be taking over the spring then?
My professor mentioned the possibility of benign able to take the course as an ‚Äúindependent study‚Äù (since I‚Äôm still a UG technically) and get a 4000-level credit. Will this course only count if taken at the graduate level rather than an independent study?"
Thank you so much! Will it be considered a ‚Äúcognate course?‚Äù
i can send the syllabus once it's available and/or i can put you in contact with the professor that's teaching it
"the syllabus is still under development, but here is the hokiespa description and the description sent by the professor that volunteered to teach it",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1004089898371924069/1039270647450316830/image.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1004089898371924069/1039270647827812432/image.png
<@996498411782152272> do you know if this is possible and if there's anyone I can contact with regards to it?
i can send the email of the professor if that is necessary
"Is there any policy for applying to have a graduate level course double count for a different department? Next semester I wanted to take PSCI 5554 (Culture, Politics and Society in Network Environments) and it'll be about the social origins of computing (ie the different networks that were set up to advance computing when it first started and what philosophy they created/consumed, etc.).
It is more qualitative than the traditional CS courses (the primary coursework will be reading theory rather than coding) but the relevancy of the topic to CS (in addition to me really wanting to take this class) made me want to ask if it was possible to double count it as a CS grad course for my last semester of UG"
"thank you so much, i will do that!"
i understand that a course at that level has you reading a bunch of research papers. i‚Äôve been taking political theory courses for the past 3 semesters with upwards of 100+ pages a week so i feel i would be able to handle that part. is there more to it that distinguishes it from a 5000 level course?
what process would i have to go through in order to get into CS 6804 (ML in graphs) as a ugg? same as any other graduate course and just adding it to my course sheet? or is there more to it?
"Since I am in the accelerated program, would I have to re-fill out this form if I plan on making changes for next semester?
https://graduateschool.vt.edu/content/dam/graduateschool_vt_edu/forms/Accelerated_UG-GR_Degree_and_Course_Designation_Request.pdf"
"I think I want to try to switch into the MS program and found the ""change of degree level"" form. Would it be possible to set up a meeting to discuss this potential action?"

ofc!
"https://libcom.org/article/anarcho-syndicalism-rudolf-rocker
https://libcom.org/article/tragedy-spain-rudolf-rocker"
So his Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice is most likely a good place to start
Rudolf Rocker is a classic anarcho-syndicalist
"Bookchin did a bit of work on anarcho-syndicalism, though it was mostly critique"
"looking into it, i don't actually have any readings on the spanish revolution, unfortunately"
"but i‚Äôd probably stay away from homage of catalonia, heard there‚Äôs a bit of sensationalism there"
i‚Äôll pull up my laptop and see if i have anything saved
plus real world application rather than just theory
"id probably look at catalonia and the cnt+fai, they were syndicalist"
grape mf

something like that
sharing 1 connection across 7 people üëç
"sorry, in place w/limited internet rn"
"leaning a bit to the stirner side of things, but that may be because i‚Äôm unfamiliar with some of the things bookchin was discussing"
lemme get on laptop i can send a bit of theory if you want
the modern-day mutual aid
social ecology is a good thing to be familiar with tho
reading that sorta requires you to be familiar with a bunch of other people lol
started with his ecology of freedom‚Ä¶ was a bit of a mistake
so your option would be data analytics + physics
basically data science
computational modeling and data analytics
may i suggest the physics option of cmda
math is good stuff
nice

then this semester there‚Äôs a course on marxian political analysis which i‚Äôll be going to
lovely terrorist studies professor
Priya Dixit
which is pretty good for a grad level psci course
there were 6 of us
they go hand in hand
"mostly theory, some history"
yee
"they had a course on the subject last semester, believe it or not"
that do be nice
"dang, their insta is dead

https://www.instagram.com/mutual_aid_org/"
or they abandoned virginia tech servers and are using their own decentralized communications network
might‚Äôve been disbanded
that is interesting‚Ä¶ could‚Äôve sworn they were there before
you can also try to find it on gobbler connect
they were at gobblerfest last year
"ydsa is alive, though i can‚Äôt say i‚Äôve been to many of their meetings, mostly at the start of the year"

"my own 2 cents: i see GPT-3 as a tool playing a role akin to a calculator (albeit a more powerful one). sure, you can use it to write an essay/answer a math problem (and many people do/will use it for that), but it ends up not developing your capacity as a person, so if you personally want to learn how to write a good paper, you can do it, otherwise you'll just be taking the calculator option of getting over it. it's not that different from the traditional issues we have in schooling. imo the issue becomes terrifying when the tool can be used to write something like a dissertation,.at that point it is more than just a tool since it can itself produce new knowledge that humanity hasn't come up with. it becomes more than a parrot"

yeaaaaah same here lol"
thank you team üôè
100 LETS GO
smallest score needed for an A in this class
hopefully y'all's finals are going alright
praying for a 95 on phase 7

"we can stop now if you want, gotta eat and prepare for class"
i cannot hear you it seems
i uploaded the new tableau document to whoever is presenting that
"it's alright, i think we should be good"
<@1011283503192735834> can you hear me?
combined5
or someone else that has tableau installed
<@234504069123801088> can we borrow your laptop?
@everyone where y'all at?

"apologies for taking a bit, just started a project due in 2 days and my partner has been less than helpful"
sure gimme a moment
elsewhere?
zoom?
"sure, where?"
i'm gonna speak
that's what i was asking
works on my end
@everyone any updates
when do people want to meet and how do y‚Äôall want to practice? over zoom? in person?
tomorrow morning would be nice
got the colors working
yeah sounds good to me
will get on in a bit
sorry i got home 5 minutes ago
i‚Äôll be biking over momentarily
after class ends at 5:15 i can join y‚Äôall
"small worry that came up during peer review: 2018+19 and 2020+21 are measured using different metrics, so i tried normalizing to try to make it comparable between the sets of years, but that made it impossible to compare between the years (for example the transition between 2019 + 2020 is pivotal, but it's hard to make a direct comparison because each year is normalized within itself)"

"yes, Africa is highlighted for the lower scores/gdp per capita"

we good
it should work now
maybe we can send a url to the more unstable version in the writeup?
"nvm, making it more efficient would require adding a bit of the stuff from my side of things"
that's the big difference
wait y'all are still using the for loop for coloring?
want me to make it more efficient?
sure
yeah
i see
the one that requires the map to be refreshed
who's turning it in?
added them,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1014628476998930546/1038273499812339712/image.png
gonna look into it
for whatever reason it appears that when the brush specifically is added the axis titles disappear
i am back
"i‚Äôll be home in ~20-30 minutes, i‚Äôll check then"
where some of the time it doesn‚Äôt load?
ah
it lags?
"i commented them out because i was looking for bugs, uncommented them and they sorta just disappeared"

it was working yesterday
interesting
"hm, lemme check"
fuck you javascript
weird behavior debugged
"debugged, just getting weird behavior now"
nvm is bugged
smooth as can be
i got it to work
"still fairly inefficient, unsure if that helped performance in any way"

,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1014628476998930546/1037436077042053172/unknown.png
one issue with this is it prevents hover-info in the scatterplot
got a meeting at 4 so i'll try to complete as much as i can rn
somewhat
and the colors now work
got the box to select the points inside
we can drag a box and identify the parts of the scatterplot we want displayed on the map
he's what i was thinking in terms of interaction,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1014628476998930546/1037413951278952478/unknown.png
i think the inspirational notebook was able to deal with that
if nothing was done i was gonna make an individual document and go through it line by line
nice
was it done using your map <@234504069123801088>
holy DAMN

"i'll join in a couple minutes, just got off tutoring"

"finishing up some chores, gonna get on after dishes"
sure
no and i chose not to bother with it because i have a lot due tonight üò≠
it'd appear there's a way to make the graph interactive w/o actually adding interaction
"i‚Äôll be skipping today, got a lot on my plate"
i‚Äôll start tonight
i thought the second part was done for us
i haven't started

lmk if y'all can see it
so we can make a team notebook for phase 5
making a team and then adding everyone to it
even with pro i could still only add 4 people
"Sorry I went mia, I was really focusing on a project for a different class. Ended up turning it in Friday morning a day late"
"gonna try my best, currently trying to bash through a systems assignment"
"got tutorings through 8, but idk how much i'd be able to contribute with a systems assignment being due tonight"
got us a conference table
yeah we can try. got a big assignment on my end but i think i got it under control
i chose to make the labels accurate at the expense of everything else
dang
can you tell for the other axes?
and translate the axis a bit to the left
"add a ""transform"" .attr"
i think that‚Äôs too far to the left
i think it matters more that the top is aligned than the rest
it was more misaligned before
assuming your lines are to the left of their ticks
move the lines to the left a bit so it all lands on top of each other
move em a bit
it's all in order now,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1014628476998930546/1027407563848953916/unknown.png

"used reference for coloring, not getting any colors ü•≤"
"if you're using path the formatting for this array is something like... `[[0,0], [10, 20], [50, 80]]` and you'll get a connection at those coordinates"

ayyyyyy,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1014628476998930546/1027312414229803118/unknown.png
basically cut out the abbreviation and then add it onto the library in the end with its own encoding
"```js
axesXScales = new Map(
  Array.from(axesNames.slice(1), (key) => [
    key
    d3.scaleLinear(

    .scaleBand()
    .domain(table.map((r) => r.Abbrev))
    .range([margin.left, width - margin.right])
)
```"
looking into it
"it works with numerics, but not textual columns"
saw bug in the code i posted in that it doesn't really do anything about abbreviations
gonna bug the ta about how to make the poly lines

cush
that specific line is looking for a floating point exception error to be created by the shell
ah ic
iirc the ta's only look at the functions that have tests + documentation for them?
and a relevant pfp to go along with it
"and with the stderr test it writes `stderr\nstdout` to the output file, i am very unsure why there is a discrepancy between local shell i/o and test i/o"
but when i run cush i can by hand create a file in /tmp/ and cat it out
"merged advanced functionality into the main branch and now i'm getting errors such as 
```

yeah i had confusion translating from python formatting to shell code üòÖ
"Trying to figure out why `sendline('echo hi | cat > {0}; < {1} rev | cat | rev | rev'.format(tmpfile, tmpfile))` in the multiple_pipes test would result in the prompt not being printed afterwards. I'd run the test in cush but idk the exact combination of shell code that'd result in that exactly.
Would it just be something like `echo hi | cat | rev | cat | rev | rev`?"
i would not know then
ah
on my local machine it was printing out `Unknown error 136` and the like
"i had that error, turns out `strsignal(status)` gives you a different result depending on the distro"
locally on a linux distribution?
would `fg` + `bg` without any other parameters be considered a built-in?
Would a TA be open to me sending the ideas my group implemented for built-ins? I wanna make sure we're performing enough testing
is it outputting anything?
is the command outputting ls?

"forgive my persistence on posix/^C/^Z, for whatever reason I'm able to set up other parts but that is just a thorn in my side that's preventing me from raising the basic score above 7"
"thought so, but would that pose an issue for creating a new gpid for process 0 of the pipe? i understand setting it for non-zeroth commands in the pipeline you just set pgid to the first ppid but that isn't possible for process 0 since posix_spawnp wasn't called it"
small question: does it matter for the actions/attributes whether they're set up before/after posix spawn?
"ended up working out in the end, thank you for your help!"

if it's in path it'll be used
i'm doing p1 locally sooooo gonna pull
:o
there was an update?
in ssh directory
`touch config`
it doesn't have a file extension
config is just named config

`snprintf` is allowed iirc
check for shebang notation maybe?
"That makes a lot of sense, thank you!"
"A point of confusion on my end: `wait_for_job` and `handle_child_status` both assert that `SIGCHLD` is blocked. However, if I understand correctly, `SIGCHLD` triggers upon pressing `^Z` or `^C`, so how would the shell be able to detect it while waiting for the foreground job in `wait_for_job` to finish if the `SIGCHLD` is blocked?"
i had some statements in there for debugging purposes
really? i thought otherwise was mentioned
nvm i think i have it. you just don't give it terminal control?
How would one spawn a process in the background using posix_spawn? Would calling `posix_spawnattr_tcsetpgrp_np` on an arbitrary non-foreground fd work?

it does prevent you from using exit tho

"i am using it for `%d` so that should not be an issue, thank you"
just making sure: `scanf` is banned but `sscanf` is fair game?
you need to run make in the non-src folder you‚Äôre given

"yeah that is very fair, gotta actually teach. i think in terms of that then a ta position will probably be not as useful to me since i actually taught classes, so i am more than able to demonstrate my ability to teach through that"
do you feel being a TA helped you resume-wise?

"fair enough, it's definitely a thing that you don't need to learn in order to be a successful programmer, though it is a fun rabbithole to go down if you got free time"
then you have ways of searching for specific words and teleporting to files and function definitions
"vim has ways of teleporting around your documents. like, if you wanna move up 9 lines you can type 9k (k = up key) and go up 9 lines, then 9j (j = down) will go back down 9 lines"
"don't have to try to learn about it if you don't want, but it's not that scary and there's a tutorial on rlogin that lets you more easily learn it"
"memes aside i do think that vim's learning curve isn't as bad as people say. there's just a lot that the editor can do, so it gives the impression that it's an insurmountable learning task, but you can use the editor with very basic knowledge and can just add on commands to your work flow as you learn them. 
like, you start off with hjkl (vim's equivalent of arrowkeys), i (which puts you in insert mode and type stuff), <esc> to leave insert mode, and :w :q :wq (writing/saving and quitting) and you have basic notepad functionality
then step 2 is learning about object-actions, at which point you're learning stuff that's putting you ahead of notepad"
"eh yeah, it's an issue unique to me"
which is a part of why i ended up switching to keyboard only so i could disable touchpad
"touch pad has its uses, though in my case it's very sensitive, so if my hand accidentally brushes over it while i'm typing it makes my typing thing go to where my cursor is"
"which is pretty comfy imo, don't have to lift your hands to do anything"
"though once you go through the effort, you can stop using the mouse for pretty much everything"
the easiest being running the `vimtutor` command in rlogin (or local shell if you have vim installed)
"eh, there's ways of easing into it"
to people that use vim
vim is actually pretty easy to use

ah
i was setting up attribute + actions before
that was my issue
ah
or is everything supposed to be set up after posix spawn lol
can it be set after posix_spawn is called?
so setpgroup isn't called for process 0?
"one issue i'm running into is the creation of a new process group, since posix_spawnattr_setpgroup requires a pgid in place but that still needs to be generated for the first item so idk"
"we do use it i think, though we may only have applied it to the first process to have spawned. should it have been all of them?"
does the ordering of those matter? i assume not since you're making changes to the attribute
"managed to narrow down the range of errors to an issue of pgid (i think) in that the gpid of the spawned fg process is the same as cush, though i am unsure how exactly to fix it"

yes
"i will say that a single piped shell command can do everything, which is pretty cool"
yeah lol
try `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
using hashbang notation?
my solution to this was to use version control and run make on rlogin so i'd have rlogin's specific memory optimizations (tried making both locally and on rlogin and there was a difference in file sizes) so then i was able to perform analysis locally w/ rlogin specifications

means logic is being implemented wrong
hm got a segfault in `swap` for quicksort
though there was a segfault one time (out of 10 runs)
"<@392772253684858881> the output is:
```sh
sort failed
aborted
```"
checking advanced...
although with the advanced tests it's a tossup between whether it's correct or not (1-4 thread advanced tests *usually* pass but higher threads rarely)
"all the basic tests pass, for whatever reason running it through helgrind makes them slow"
"and commenting the work stealing out makes helgrind timings ""normal"""
basically <@392772253684858881> we found that we have a buggy work stealing implementation and it's causing basic helgrind tests to go 5+ minutes and we're trying to debug it
it's a crappy shell but it remains a shell
"i doubt it, idt powershell would set up a server in ssh"
nvm the basic tests are quicker
fair enough
it's been an issue with both the basic and advanced tests
taking several minutes is typical then? even though enabling `--fair-sched` makes it speed up to under a minute?
Any recommendations on how to figure out what's causing helgrind to be abysmally slow?
so unless you're somehow making your worker threads call it that's not what's happening
"calling all the ""frontend commands"" is the job of the parent thread, meaning it'll have to finish thread_pool_new and only then will run any subsequent commands"
the former
fair enough lol
what the autograder doing üëÄ
which tests are you using? because the first couple don't really deal with internal submissions
"well, then you can make a check in the submit function if it's null or not and proceed as needed."
"probably a bit late to ask, but: how long should helgrind take to process one of the bigger commands?"
it'd not be null if it was initialized (which probably happens in the static worker function)
yeah it's 80% of the whole score
fjdriver
would `ps -a` also do it?
"thank you mr bernard, this knowledge is being put to good use üôè"
did you ever get the answer
"you‚Äôre just adding 20 and 22, so a result in the millions is quite interesting"
you could be returning a pointer?
iirc that‚Äôs when no one is holding the lock
"give me sudo permissions, i swear i‚Äôll only use them to kill off zombie processes"
inb4 some vigilante goes through each node looking for running processes

thank you so much <@710252193806024775> for the help!
like it's passed instantly
"it passes the test, idk what the threads are up to"
it might be a sign of inefficient code
`valgrind --tool=helgrind ./threadpool_test -n 2`
a solid 2
unsure
or not working at all
"how long is helgrind taking y'all? it used to run fairly quick, now it's abysmally slow"
all my code takes the same amount of time (it segfaults before doing anything meaningful)
it's like a restaurant: if you introduce too many new employees they clog up the space and reduce overall efficiency. gotta tidy up your space to better take advantage of more workers
"ah, the error was in a completely separate area for us. basically we were accidentally passing the wrong type of struct and then casting it as the struct we wanted to interact with"
"assuming you locked it beforehand, it should be fine, though for some arbitrary reason i have also received a similar error"
valgrind/helgrind go brrrr
"‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt work and i don‚Äôt know why‚Äù
‚Ä¶..
‚Äúit works and i don‚Äôt know why‚Äù"
"running through gdb, it'd appear that the ""local lock"" that's created for the worker in thread_pool_new has a different address than when the worker is looked at in the static worker function"
"when going through valgrind for threadpool_test, it says we are calling up uninitialized values. however, the values are initialized within thread_pool_new, so i am unsure what to make of it. thread_pool_new initializes the locks/queues/conds in dynamically allocated threadpool/worker constructs, so i don't think it's an issue of ""references"" (though it still might be if most of the bases are covered)"
vscode using up enough resources to affect threadpool performance is quite epic
ssh via cmd prompt and log into a node where there aren‚Äôt vscode servers (or other threadpool instances) running
my bad
i don‚Äôt think ‚Äúsubmit until it works‚Äù is a strategy that‚Äôs endorsed around here
"got a similar problem here, we were unable to find a corresponding unlock or a place where another lock could be placed"
update: it was because i was passing a pointer of the pool instead of the pool itself
"to elaborate, the list can be accessed from within the thread_pool_new where it is created, but within the static function i have a pointer to the threadpool passed in through args, and when i try to reference the queue through that manner i get a `Cannot access memory at address 0x78` message"
should that be a struct list* ?
no it is not
should that be a pointer?
"my queue is a list, which is then contained within the threadpool struct"
"to make my question more straightforward, i call initialize on my queues/locks in the thread_pool_new function. however, when i call up the global queue from a reference to the threadpool itself within the static function, it says that i cannot access the queue even though i initialized it and allocated space for it through the threadpool. why can't i access it even though i called initialize?"
"and yes, i mean a queue/lock per worker (though i have taken away the locks). would i have to allocate memory to the lock/queue?"
"I guess I meant that I didn't malloc anything and pointed to them via threadpool, which seems off now that I say it"
"I am getting a `Cannot access memory at address 0xe0` when trying to reference a ""local"" lock/queue. I do not have a buffer, is that it? I set up local queues and locks before I create any threads, so I am fairly sure that it is not an issue with that. It might be an issue with allocation, but I did it statically before so I am unsure why a static approach wouldn't work now"
ps is probably better
not vscode but yes
my threads were pooling too much üòî
yeah
you can pass a struct that contains a pointer to the global queue into the thread function

ah
also adding assert statements might help
"if you are, can place breaks on all the lock statements and make sure your locks and unlocks work"
you failing threadpool_test?
"mhm, imagined that was the case"
otherwise you‚Äôre exiting the function with a held lock which is bad
the line above it
i meant unlock it before you return
your list is an array?
the rule of thumb is: if you lock something in a function you want to unlock it later in the function after shared resources stop being shared
a couple pages though i went into too much detail
you probably want to unlock pthread_mutex_lock(w->worker) after you're done making stolen_future finished = true
ooh syntex highlighting
ah i meant on your end üòÖ
or ig code would work as well
if you want you can send pseudocode with locks
it‚Äôs all good
if you want you can send your logic with it and i can tell you where y'all might've screwed up
it checks for emptiness?
what's confusing you?
instead of a for loop it might be better to use a while loop
through a couple of if statements you can replicate the behavior of a circular list
yeah
since each worker can start with the worker after it and just keep going until it reaches its own elem
circular lists should help with that theoretically
by popping it straight off the queue!
you need a few checks but should be an easy implement
like how you‚Äôre thinking
circular lists üëÄ

"just gotta fix realloc-bal, everything else is good"
unless i'm misunderstanding
mark_block_free calls set_header_and_footer which then turns the size into whatever
"looking at the project code, mark_block_free initializes the size"
yah
yeah
^ segregated free lists + non-linear find_fit is the way
"i have implemented two pieces of code that, when either one is commented out it, works. however, when both are in it, there is a  ""did not preserve old block"" error on realloc1. this dual nature is what has me confused. the pieces of code in question are:
```
realloc case 4 (specifically if the combined size of all 3 blocks - words required >= MIN_BLOCK_SIZE_WORDS), it works in the other case
```
```
a check in find fit that checks if the highest memory free list has anything in it and yanks from that if it does
```
would there be an obvious place to look for the source of this discrepancy?"
"yeah, it was the case in p2 too"
submission autograder is weaker. ta's will run your program independently
"getting a similar error. the first time it happened the memcpy was overriding the current block's size, so be sure to store blk_size before doing the memcpy shenanigans"

mm.c + documentation
just the 5 are good
"yee, remove everything related to the coalesce and then mark the resulting block as free üòé
that was the issue?"
"i kept heap_listp as an ""implicit"" list (that way you can refer to prev/next block easily) and having the free list on top of it. if you're finding that there remain free blocks under such a setup, you're not removing from the free list properly"
that seems good
"if we were to copy the start of malloc for realloc, would `awords` be the variable that interacts with the sizes of the blocks?"
around 10 is recommended by people on here
depends on your list count

"anywho, anyone up for some lawless stateless chaos?"
whereas if you come in with a genuine question you might learn something and change your mind
that‚Äôs a downside of arguing: everyone gets ingrained into their position and doesn‚Äôt wanna budge
"it‚Äôs all good, apologies if i came off harsh. i think of it this way: <#902281863152955493> for debates, while this thread can be used to share resources/talk about anarchist theory without having to devolve into a struggle fest on whether the premise for the theory is valid. if you have a question on why an anarchist thinks something, feel free to ask here, but no need for it to get into an argument"
this thread specifically
\*sigh\* whatever happened to this
otherwise the meme wouldn't have many variations of it
"it is perfectly understood by most self-identified socialists/communists, i feel"
"anywho, to wrap this debacle up: socialists use the first ""proper"" definition because it's harmful to link the ""two definitions"" together like that, so in the context of this thread the meme is understood to be ""how will these organisms survive without a free market to guide their actions."" if you have issues feel free to take it to <#902281863152955493> and let the people here meme without getting into an hour long debate on how a meme doesn't make sense"
_ _
"""each species benefits"" would have the same meaning as ""each species profits"" except w/o the socio-political implications"
in biology specifically this is called mutualism
"the act itself can be considered ""mutual aid"""
mutual benefit
"is a good read, would recommend"
"now to get back to reading about ""manufacturing consent"""
"and my problem is that both definitions are linked together. you end up with a sort of logic that ""profit is an economic term that sums up how one accumulates capital"" while at the same time ""profit is when someone does something that benefits them"" and then go ""hmmmmmm profit must be good and always existed."" it ends up just benefiting the capitalist class and legitimizes their claim to this capital"
it's a politically charged definition because the context it is used in is purely political
"that is the joke behind these styles of memes: the notion of a ""profit motive"" is a purely modern phenomena that is derived from capitalist relations, so mushrooms have no means of developing a profit motive and neither do tribal societies that haven't developed individualistic philosophy (such as what happened in the enlightenment)"
"here's a proper definition of profit: unpaid labour expropriated from workers by a capitalist and distributed by various means among the capitalist class, measured in proportion to the total capital invested."
"it doesn't have a motive like a human does, it just does"
"i don't think a mushroom is capable of making a conscious decision like that, it doesn't choose anything, it just does what it does"
the fact that mushrooms and plants don‚Äôt do profit is the point of the meme üòõ
it‚Äôs a projection
i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly appropriate to apply concepts that describe interactions between humans primarily in the past 3 centuries to mushrooms

the anarchist platform do be quite fun
"anywho, off to <#902281863152955493> with ya"
"in general, this communal anarchism tries to prevent the buildup of power within hierarchies (such a gangs or corporations) and instead spread it among the people, with mechanisms to prevent the buildup of a hierarchical power within a single entity"
one of the misconceptions that marx had about anarchism is the belief that anarchists only wanted to go after the state and capitalism would fall afterwards while the ‚Äúlogical marxists go after the root of the problem in capitalism.‚Äù anarchists want to go after both
"anarchism is in general anti-hierarchy, so it‚Äôd be anti-corporation"
.
"on the topic of a reading list, i will be heading home for the holidays and there‚Äôs been a few books that were in progress that i wanted to finish reading:
Propaganda in the Information Age: Still Manufacturing Consent - it‚Äôs a series of essays on the manufacturing consent model by Herman/Chomsky, either expanding its mode of analysis (such as adding in gender and racial filters) or analyzing the media with respect to the rise of the internet. if you want an intro into the model w/o reading the book Manufacturing Consent i recommend this video: <https://youtu.be/34LGPIXvU5M>
Ecology of Freedom - the classical Bookchin book, i still got a couple chapters to read, the man is fairly dense. wouldn‚Äôt recommend for a newbie
Seeing Like a State - a modern classic for anarchists (although James C Scott himself is not an anarchist) that looks at the simplifying structures that are required to occur for a state setup to function well (this phenomena is what i discussed with <@377268351635947530> last night). i still have a lot to read with regards to this one, but thus far it has been entertaining"
i need to read more of Graeber‚Äôs works (may he rest in peace)
"in some fun cases you can end up with a single individual that is godly amounts of power in the region they‚Äôre in who is unable to express is over a territory because there‚Äôs no state apparatus (if they tried to create a state it just wouldn‚Äôt work because then it‚Äôd be sharing power with a god). you ended up creating a bunch of rituals that limited what this godly being can do to prevent them from just doing whatever (maybe they‚Äôre not allowed to touch the ground for some religious reason so they have to be carried around, something limiting like that), so you can end up in a social setup where you have a godly individual that can do whatever they wanted but since they‚Äôre a non-state individual that can‚Äôt be everywhere in their territory (which sometimes was composed of multiple villages) it allows the people to fairly easily avoid this person. so you might end up with a village devoted to this person and then all ‚Äútheir‚Äù village territories outside the village operate autonomously without their supervision. it‚Äôs a quite fun history to look into"
to look into this phenomena i‚Äôd recommend Graeber ‚Äòs dawn of everything
in the cases there is one can argue fairly successfully that it‚Äôs a government without a state (once again on the lack of formal institutions with which to carry stuff out. it‚Äôs rather unsurprising that tribes wouldn‚Äôt be spending time developing a bureaucracy)
not always no
"anywho, bed time for me it‚Äôs 4:30 ü•≤"
"how would this tribal society, clearly capable of self-governance, be able to do so in the absence of a executive/legislative body"
"i tend to be in agreement, though i am eager to see how Lukas makes the distinction"
"how would tribal self-governance fall under those categories, given their lack of legislative/executive bodies?"
"i am curious to hear what your perception of anarchism is, however"
"i have to go to sleep now, but this distinction is the main one i see between a state and government <@312999155633094660> . a state keeps political/legislative functions within a circle of people above society, while anarchism attempts to bring those functions down to the people. feel free to call it ‚Äúa state with democracy cranked up to 100‚Äù (to quote a friend of mine), but that is my belief"
how are you distinguishing state and government?
a form of government? yes. a state where political functions are located above society? that‚Äôs a tougher ask to prove
"i will say i have to research more into the specifics of how these anarchist experiments were able to scale to millions of people, i just know that these experiments exist(ed) (and are/were fairly internally stable)"
"it's a political role where the person themselves has very limited power to do what they want (basically the delegate can't do something that the community doesn't approve of [this is called a ""limited mandate""]). in addition there is the communal power of instant recall where the delegate can be recalled. in addition, there is also the idea of a frequent rotation of community delegates, in order to prevent the political buildup of a single delegate. this rotation also encourages everyone to be versed in these direct political processes since they will have the chance to be delegate too (think jury duty except not as horrible)"
"well, it's a bit more than impeachment"
"you articulate the direct citizens' opinion, and if you go out of the line of the community consensus you can be recalled and your votes nullified"
"it would be something akin to that, i imagine"
not quite. remember what i said concerning an anarchist mayor?
"to add onto this <@312999155633094660>, a face-to-face direct democracy between hundreds of thousands of people will probably not work, i forsee it working only at the scale of a handful of thousand of people. beyond that there'd need to be some form of delegation to help streamline the process somewhat at a higher scale"
i'm not against organization. organization is inevitable within human society (given our being social organisms). i favor certain forms of organizing over others
jane jacobs and her writings on the urban communities is something to look into if this is something that interests you
you'd be surprised by how much attitudes can change through a radical transformation of city/urban architecture and design
"this, in my opinion, serves only to simplify the factors down to ones that can be comprehended by the state"
"i feel that has become the role of the state in recent years: try to prevent the next worldly disaster through various technocratic means. there are some people that have stifled this plan (Trump disbanding the US pandemic preparation team comes to mind), but in general i believe that is the trend being approached"
my very specific brand of socialism that everyone must follow to a t
"true, but that is a very modern phenomena. the city used to be and can become a much more trusting environment."
these closely knit communities can be created and expanded
"not in the near future, no, but it is something that can be built up"
there's more to it than just direct democracy
there must be formed bonds of fraternity and mutual aid where people can rely on each other and view each other as equals
"sure, but the conscious acceptance of anarchism would require the people to accept a more liberators worldview. a stateless society wouldn‚Äôt be able to survive if everyone were able to do whatever. that is one of the major differences between anarchism and capitalist libertarianism: the libertarian allows for the ‚Äúunimpeded development of an individual‚Äù that can allow the festering of hierarchical and domination-based worldviews such as fascism because if anything troubling arises the state can just throw them in prison. an anarchist society doesn‚Äôt have this luxury, so it must be able to fester a non-hierarchical view in order to maintain its society"
fascism is predicated on the idea that one people are above another. it‚Äôs built on a hierarchy. which anarchists tend to oppose
i doubt that
"although there's no state to police the people's disrespect of minority groups, the acceptance of anarchist principles tends to go hand in hand with liberation of minority groups"
a more humorous/serious example,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1038964937084653650/1051765013083340810/iu.png
i will say that transsexual rights (and queer rights in general) are widely supported among anarchists organizations
and what are you gonna do about it? vote for someone else and hope they're unlike the rest of the legislative body?
"in the case of representative democracy, you vote for someone and hope they do something that you want. you can choose not to vote for them next election cycle if you want to, but there's a good chance they're re-elected or the person after them also doesn't do anything. 
this disconnect becomes more apparent if you choose to actually try and participate in your state's political system and testify on pieces of legislation. in my home state in the us (and a couple more states in which my research group did research in), there is a very large disconnect between how much positive testimony pieces of legislation get vs how likely that legislation is to be passed. most pro-climate bills end up having 90+% approval but are nowhere near as likely to pass, it's so disheartening"
"a second, related, question: would you willingly participate in a body where you get to give your opinion on a matter and then have other people decide what happens independent of your opinion?"
would you willingly want to participate in a body where you get to directly decide on what happens in your community?
sure
"here is the big thing about anarchism: this political participation and collectively deciding on what to do in the community is one of the bases of the community, so participation and coming to a consensus are a part of the same process"
would you <@312999155633094660> be willing to participate in a community body where you get to decide what you'll be spending your day working on? would you have the same incentive to participate within politics if you weren't in control of what you'd be allowed to do as a result of this participation?
"because the functioning of the community is in the hands of the people. community decisions literally can't be made without the people being present, which is not the case for a state where decisions are pondered over whether or not the general community/public is there to offer an opinion"
"the thing with anarchism is that, because people are directly in control of politics, there is more incentives to participate in them even when times are good. you would be voting directly for what will happen/be added to your community and will get to say what you will be able to do to make those things happen. there's no higher power that does all the political stuff in the background, that power is thrusted upon you"
especially when it comes to the development of non-state institutions that do more than just vote (there's so many political things one can do aside from just voting and working within the state apparatus)
"it might be a bit of a over-simplification, but people do tend to be more politically active in times of economic hardships (because now the state/capitalism's fuckery is affecting them in a very bad way)"
"sorta yeah, do you entrust political ongoings to a power high above or do you entrust it to the people"
"there is also a sort of contradiction that ends up being created within a liberal state that is interesting to think about: 
the state takes upon itself several roles in maintaining a society. the individuals that compose this society thus don't have any reason to participate in the ongoings of this society since the state just operates everything in the background. as a result, the state is sorta just free to do as it wants until there is some disaster (economic depression or the state overextends with oppressive policies) that causes people to wake up and do something. this happens until things slow down and people become complacent again. it becomes a cycle"
"a specifically anarchist community imo is capable of enforcing individual liberties, in many cases surpassing the state, especially within the community. if a community has reached the point where it is consciously practicing anarchism, one can rely on their community members that individual rights are protected. there is a reason anarchists have been very ahead of their time in terms of reforms guaranteeing individual liberties (universal suffrage [at a communal level], 40 hour workweek [with many calling for a decrease to that], recognition of queerness, etc. most of these ""civilized reforms"" have been argued by anarchists at least a few decades before the issues became mainstream)
looking at the state, one can point to several examples where a state is actively surpassing individual liberties (in some states much more than others). the core of the issue here is one that anarchists very much disagree with: these liberties are being guaranteed by a power above the people that often has its own agenda. there is nothing the people can do about it, since the decrees of the state are enforced through brutal violence (as seen in the police force) and the manufacturing of consent (as seen through state and corporate media)"
although a community is much more directly involved than this piece of paper
it's similar to a constitution in that way: you can't take my private property because a 200 y/o piece of paper said so
but this idea of an anarchist community must consciously be within the community in order for it to function. the people in it have to actively want to maintain a state of anarchy
i understand this is probably not the most concrete answer you're looking for
"with that example specifically i do not imagine the person would be capable of defending themselves against the entire rest of the community (though we shouldn't forget that the state apparatus also holds the ability to force people to do something). as such, the prerequisite to an anarchist community would be a recognition of individual liberties as well as a communal bond. 

this is a high ask, so i'd imagine the vast majority of modern communities in the developed world would be incapable of turning into an anarchist community overnight."
"ik, writing down an answer"
"with those the individual has the right to not follow through with them, but it is also within the right of the community to not have to interact with that person."
ah my b
mask/vaccine mandates i think are a slightly more interesting topic to look at in terms of individual vs collective liberties imo
"anarchists believe in individual, as well as communal, rights. where anarchism differs from other strains of thought is that the individual and communal liberties can coexist and build up one another. the individual having the freedom to do what they want best contributes to the collective while the collective can bolster an individual's ability to do something (you won't have to worry about food/shelter as much, since that's communally created/owned)"
trying my best to answer
"i understand, i get these questions quite a bit"
"not exactly lol, the self-defense is more against violent actions (such as rape, attempted murder, etc). if there's a more civil dispute, the community can decide on the proper course of action itself. you and your neighbor can talk the matter through beforehand, and if an agreement isn't reached then you have people around you that can help settle matters"
"anarchism is a form of communist thought imo, it just tries to achieve them through non-state means (unlike something like the soviet union). you try to create a community with stateless, moneyless, classless relationships at the very beginning, so when your community expands you have these ideas in mind guiding you"
anarchists tend to have a focus on self-defense in that way. why call upon an unelected cop from an institution famously known for dishuman and racist treatment of people when you and your neighbors are capable of dealing with an issue yourselves?
"theoretically, an anarchist community is capable of self-policing. there's no need for a higher power to divvy out justice."
looking at contemporary examples there have been examples to the tune of millions of people that didn't internally implode
that's the beauty of anarchism in my opinion. you're trying to create a big society capable of scale without introducing hierarchy into the mix
"sorta, yeah"
"a delegate being someone w/o formal voting power (like a representative in the modern state would have), but rather expresses the direction chosen by the people that made them delegate"
"to define the state more specifically... the state is a hierarchical power structure where a group of people exist ""above"" the rest of society and make decisions for that society. they enforce these decisions through a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. there are some key terms here that an anarchist would be against"
so something like a tribal society would be practicing self-government. to call that a state (especially with the modern idea of a bureaucratic state) would be a tad of a stretch
government is a group of people participating in collective decisionmaking
there's a crucial difference
they're technically mayor but the direct democracy makes the decisions
i imagine the mayor would become something akin to a delegate
"if you have a bit of time, would also recommend looking at this as a method of modern anarchist praxis. it‚Äôs only a handful of pages but provides a useful means by which an anarchist program won‚Äôt be diluted by a general populace that‚Äôs less keen on statelessness"
"there‚Äôs many facets one can start in, though the movement would have to start local/grassroots. one can build up relationships through many things, such as creating a community garden that is able to dual purpose provide people with food where commodities might not help, and also help decommodify  resources. one could also pursue political ends, such as running for mayor of a town and use that as a platform to create a policy of direct democracy in the town. one could also tap into the labor movement and help create unions and cooperatives that can then work together in a decentralized manner."
"all compatible with a system of ‚Äúusufruct,‚Äù ownership being determined by who is using a particular item"
library economics in general are a sick concept
a library with a piano for renting out a piano anyone can use would be pretty cool
i‚Äôm taking your toothbrush
"i feel you‚Äôre trying to equate anarchism with lawless chaos? when in reality the anarchisms that‚Äôre advocated for here are anything but chaotic (spontaneity is something that‚Äôs prized, but that‚Äôs different from chaos). rather, you‚Äôre creating a stable social/political/economic structure in the absence of a state (or any other hierarchy). this system, were it to survive state oppression, would most likely be powerful enough to not let a new state form in its midst. this would be true on a local and non-local scale, since there are ways of organizing en masse that don‚Äôt involve subordination to a hierarchy"
it largely comes down to a definitional difference too
"i'd say classical libertarianism and anarchism are synonymous, at least they have the same roots"
both can coincide üçµ

If one of us loses this desire to be seen by an other, what becomes of the other? They become a subordinate to the independent gigachad, constantly seeking meaning from them but not receiving it because the independent does not require it to live. The independent gigachad becomes the dominator. But what if the reliant gigachad realizes this relationship? This the lord fears, they end up fearing each other for different reasons: The former for what will happen once the other realizes this, and the latter for being subordinated to the lord. I pray this day does not come when this relationship must be seen to the end, for now I am thankful to be Gigachad of the year! Thank you everyone!"
"I would like to thank everyone who made this possible: my family, friends, and cat. None of this would have been possible without you all. I am at a loss for words, I just can‚Äôt believe I made it this far in the Russian School of Mathematics Student Tutor Program in the DC Region. Thank you all!
You know, it never occurred to me why I would receive this award, so it got me wondering ""how does one become a chad?"" Obviously one can become a chad by being swol, but I'm not swol, and there are other tutors more swole than me, so it must have been something else. I do not believe I am doing anything special on the RSM discord, aside from that one time over the summer when Arsenii and I would spend until 4 am talking about Linux, LaTeX, and Neovim. Though, if my brain recalls correctly, that is when a majority of the ""lurking chad reacts"" that were made towards me happened then, when I was helping with the subtle nuances of various niche subjects (such as what the difference between `:x` and `:wq` is within the general vim world. On the surface they appear identical, but when you dwell a bit deeper you learn that `:wq` forces you to save the buffer and then close, while `:x` only saves if changes were made. This little nuance will generally not matter [except in the scenario where you accidentally forget to submit an assignment for class and have to prove to your teacher that you finished the assignment before the due date. If you used `:wq` then your time stamp gets updated, as a write is forced through, while `:x` stops that from happening]). So that got me thinking: ""Maybe it is because of how I am perceived by others that would get me this far?"" This purely dialectical solution of searching for my meaning in others appears to be the correct method, for how can one be classified as a chad if there is no one around to do the classifying?"

Coffee or tea?
"as stated, things are more or less normative with regards to this (well, there‚Äôs descriptive things that can be said, i just don‚Äôt have the time to articulate them), my main point was to articulate a distinction between capitalism (regulated and not) and socialism"
"to get a bit pedantic: placing a regulation to treat workers better remains firmly capitalist. you still got private ownership over MoP and resources are still being commodified. with something like nationalized healthcare, for example, you are at least decommodifying the resource, so it is socialist in that way (though you still gotta work on bringing shit down to the ownership of the workers). promoting cooperatives brings control down to the worker level but you end up keeping resources commodified, the complete opposite issue as nationalization"
"you are assigning profits to someone simply because they own the property (in most cases they didn't even build it, rather they hired some workers to build it or bought it off someone else whose workers built it and are just extracting profits from it). normatively this is really bad imo, but i don't think there's much either of us can do to change each other's minds here (at least for now >:) ). whether that's good or bad, i would think it is still capitalism, just regulated. it is still private ownership over the MoP with a free market operating things (albeit a regulated one). 

that brings me to the next logical term to define: socialism. imo, it's ""a socio-economic system characterized by the communal control over the means of production and the decommodification of resources,"" which inherently implies that people are producing something because that something is needed, rather than that something being produced because it is profitable to do so (as is the case under capitalism). this sets the bar for calling something ""socialist"" higher than just ""when the government does stuff"""

"that being said, there are usually differences made once you read into things. there just tends to be a surface-level recognition that capitalism by its nature has certain universalities that will always get followed, but the way in which the country develops can change the way in which that country's capitalism develops"
hugs all around <:huggies:933124675104550954>
apologies on my end for being unnecessarily brash on my explanation for why i don't tend to look over differences of forms of capitalist development
"under this view it can be made a bit more clear why ""private"" property tends to lead to exploitation: you're not using the thing you own but are instead forcing someone else to work it for you!"
yeah
"interestingly it creates a distinction within the general realm of ""private property"" which we can use to create some discernible differences within our analyses"
"i think i'll take the following definitions: private property is ""property owned by an individual but not directly used by them"" (think of the factory that a capitalist pays workers to operate. the factory owner doesn't actually operate it themselves, just forces others to operate for him), which distinguishes from personal property which is ""property owned by an individual that is directly used by the individual"""
"anything that is used in the production of a commodity (raw materials, labor, the factory in which the commodity is being produced, etc.)"
"it'd depend on a definition for ""private property"" as well"
"""a socio-economic system characterized by the private ownership over the means of production expressed through a free market (that may or may not be regulated)"""
i shall now follow with my own definition for capitalism
thank you
this reminds me of the quote  `‚ÄúIt's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism‚Äù`
"so when you say that ""the far left"" does not make a distinction between forms of capitalism (especially with non-regulatory capitalism), this is (at least in my opinion) the main reason why. by keeping a capitalist class and refusing to end the exploitation inherent within private property, whether regulated or not, you end up keeping these core capitalist principles in place that will continue to do harm"
"as history unfolded, that turned out not to be the case. social democracy was able to secure worker rights (for some time at least), but as a theory of ""achieving socialism"" it was disastrous to the point where we now associate it with ""heavily regulated capitalism"""
"back before WWII social democracy referred to the reformist wing of socialist thought, where basically you electorally gain control of the state and then pass reforms until everyone's economic conditions end up being so good that you just transition into socialism/communism"
"interestingly enough, that has not always been the case"
"so yeah, nowadays social democracy is largely associated with capitalism"
feel free to add on descriptive adjectives
i have one small oversimplifying question for you: would you consider social democracy capitalism or socialism?
"Marxism is a body of socio-economic thought developed by Karl Heinrich Marx
Communism is a classless, moneyless, stateless society"
yes
would both be capitalism?
"if you're talking about Egypt 5k years ago, for sure that was the case"
at least in the modern day
"taking communism to be a ""stateless, moneyless, classless society"" (one of the few things that anarchists and marxists tend to not dispute) it's a big ask"
ehhhh
"if we take your definition of capitalism, would that mean there has been no ""real capitalism"" for the vast majority of capitalism's history?"
since i believe that is the big bottleneck at the moment
please do continue elaborating on your definitions
"nowadays that is no longer the case, various schools of socialism have created varying distinctions between the two"
"well, Marx used socialism and communism interchangeably"

 Some make a greater concession; they admit that disagreeable or unhealthy work ‚Äî such as sewerage ‚Äî could be paid for at a higher rate than agreeable work. One hour‚Äôs work of a sewerman would be worth, they say, two hours of a professor‚Äôs work. 
```
was the comment that you were making. it is mentioned that the state can mediate this way in which payment for work is given. also, Kropotkin makes the assumption that if someone wants socialism, they're against private property. 
basically Kropotkin's point was that, if the workers do a successful socialist revolution and manage to abolish private property, if they maintain a system of wage payment that involves this sort of calculus where it is determined how much different jobs are paid, you will have ended up keeping capitalism. this is because you will not have changed the way people interact with each other. people will still predominantly see each other as people earning a wage and trading that in for goods and services, which the anarchist communists want to move beyond"
"```
They say, ‚ÄúNo private property,‚Äù and immediately after strive to maintain private property in its daily manifestations. ‚ÄúYou shall be a Commune as far as regards production: fields, tools, machinery, all that has been invented up till now ‚Äî factories, railways, harbours, mines, etc., all are yours. Not the slightest distinction will be made concerning the share of each in this collective property.

‚ÄúBut from to-morrow you will minutely debate the share you are going to take in the creation of new machinery, in the digging of new mines. You will carefully weigh what part of the new produce belongs to you. You will count your minutes of work, and you will take care that a minute of your neighbours cannot buy more than yours.

‚ÄúAnd as an hour measures nothing, as in some factories a worker can see to six power-looms at a time, while in another he only tends two, you will weigh the muscular force, the brain energy, and the nervous energy you have expended. You will accurately calculate the years of apprenticeship in order to appraise the amount each will contribute to future production. And this ‚Äî after having declared that you do not take into account his share in past production.‚Äù
```"
"```
Let us own that this system appears to us unrealizable.

Collectivists begin by proclaiming a revolutionary principle ‚Äî the abolition of private property ‚Äî then they deny it no sooner than proclaimed by upholding an organization of production and consumption that originated in private property.

They proclaim a revolutionary principle, and ignore the consequences that this principle will inevitably bring about. They forget that the very fact of abolishing individual property in the instruments of work ‚Äî land, factories, road, capital, ‚Äî must launch society into absolutly new chanels; must completely overthrow the present system of production, both in its aim as well as in its means; must modify daily relations between individuals, as soon as land, machinery, and all other instruments of production are considered common property.
```"
"the following paragraphs talk about how this system ends up being unfair to some no matter how things are cut. manual labor being paid more results in a devalued education, intellectual being paid more results in a hierarchy and class division formed between intellectual and manual labor"
"```
Most collectivists, true to the distinction laid down by middle-class economists (and by Marx) between qualified work and simple work, tell us, moreover, that qualified or professional work must be paid a certain quantity more than simple work. Thus an hour‚Äôs work of a doctor will have to be considered as equivalent to two or three hours‚Äô work of a hospital nurse, or to three hours‚Äô work of a navvy. ‚ÄúProfessional, or qualified work, will be a multiple of simple work,‚Äù says the collectivist Gr√∂nlund, ‚Äúbecause this kind of work needs a more or less long apprenticeship.‚Äù

Other collectivists, such as the French Marxists, do not make this distinction. They proclaim ‚ÄúEquality of Wages.‚Äù The doctor, the schoolmaster, and the professor will be paid (in labour-cheques) at the same rate as the navvy. Eight hours visiting the sick in a hospital will be worth the same as eight hours spent in earth-works or else in mines or factories.

Some make a greater concession; they admit that disagreeable or unhealthy work ‚Äî such as sewerage ‚Äî could be paid for at a higher rate than agreeable work. One hour‚Äôs work of a sewerman would be worth, they say, two hours of a professor‚Äôs work.

Let us add that certain collectivists admit of corporations paying a lump sum for work done. Thus a corporation would say: ‚ÄúHere are a hundred tons of steel. A hundred workmen were required to produce them, and it took them ten days. Their work-day being an eight-hours day, it has taken them eight thousand working hours to produce a hundred tons of steed eight hours a ton.‚Äù For this the State would pay them eight thousand labour-notes of one hour each, and these eight thousand cheques would be divided among the members of the iron-works as they themselves thought proper.
```"
this reminds me of of a chapter in breadbook where monetary vs non-monetary socialist economies were looked at. i‚Äôll try to post the relevant parts
"it‚Äôs alright, elon‚Äôs raising the character limit to 4000 is pandering to people like us"
"there‚Äôs a difference between an anarchist and non-anarchist community in this way. a non-anarchist community would put these ‚Äúgarbage tier‚Äù jobs in the hands of a state/private corporation to manage. an anarchist community needs to perform these functions (and other functions that‚Äôd normally be taken up by the state such as policing, legislative and judicial duties) in the absence of both. it‚Äôs a prerequisite for the very existence of such a society"
"i will admit i still have to read more in-depth on the specificities on anarchist economics (been a tad busy this semester reading up on marx and cs bullshit), but in general i imagine this is how a production process of more complicated goods would work"
the dirty and intellectually unstimulating work that no one wants to do i imagine would be split up among community members on a rotating basis
"i think it‚Äôs a bit dehumanizing to have to pay for and profit from the sale of basic necessities. the best healthcare and education systems are those where this isn‚Äôt the case and the resources are decommodified. a person should tend to another‚Äôs needs because they are a fellow human, not because there‚Äôs money to be made there. 

on the other hand, from an economic perspective‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs harder to say, it‚Äôd really depend on the structure of the moneyless society. it may very well be the case that a capitalist society is better in terms of pure productivity, but that is far from the only concern of an anarchist. this question has an interesting solution when looked in terms of a post-scarcity anarchism"
"i point to the black panther party as a prime example of this. their militancy (which tends to be the main focus of modern textbooks if the bpp is ever mentioned) aside, they had extensive community networks set up that were able to provide a better defense than the police could, especially given the racial problems within the entirety of the us at the time (and these problems are more visible in the police force, so the bpp would‚Äôve had to often help community members against the cops themselves)"
"i would not trust most modern ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù to take on this role, since most interactions there tend to be mostly or purely economic (hoa‚Äôs are the primary example of this) and don‚Äôt develop much socially (at least talking from a us perspective, europe is a tad better in terms of this from what i‚Äôve seen). however, a strong communal bond can defend people within the community from outsiders and trouble inside"
"imo the community is capable of self-regulation. if a mentally unstable individual somehow obtains a gun (this‚Äôd have to be done outside the community since the community probably wouldn‚Äôt give them one since they are the most likely body to be aware of their mental health), you still have a community capable of self defense with and without guns"
"that is true, i‚Äôd expect the community/society in general to be able to regulate who has access to guns. the big meme in this entire debacle is the us claims it‚Äôs a mental health issue (imo it‚Äôs only a part of it, easy access is very much also a part of it) and then turns around and doesn‚Äôt support any initiatives meant to improve access to mental healthcare. you end up with a society with a very narrow version of individualism that results in atomization and loneliness and these individuals can then just go and get a gun without any sort of regulation or community social forces to influence this in any way"
good night o/
so the people aren‚Äôt gonna just be sitting ducks and the communities the soldiers are coming from can hold the army accountable
"this is particularly useful in helping to fight against sexual assault, since in that case the individual (usually a woman) has no one to rely on but themselves. it helps stop the cycle from happening while empowering the individual and providing a form of therapy/healing"
"so although you have a bunch of volunteers with guns organized into an army, the civilians would be encouraged to learn to learn to use a gun/defend oneself"
a theoretical (and practical) anarchist society would place the ability to defend oneself as a powerful skill to develop
although that is also assuming a completely passive population
that is true
"though all the times that anarchists were able to successfully revolt and seize control of a territory was through an organized armed uprising, so if there‚Äôs an anarchist movement there tends to be a group of people/communities that are willing to get militant over it"
one of the unfortunate parts of anarchism is you can‚Äôt force people to join the army (as that‚Äôd necessitate a hierarchy)
"unfortunately i must be off now, gotta wake up in < 6 hours"
"you have some soldiers. these soldiers delegate (""elect"") officers and higher positions as needed. these officers are directly accountable to the people and can be removed by them. for more on this topic i'd look into Nestor Makhno and the Black Army (as opposed to the White and Red armies) and how that was organized"
apologies i was busy pirating a book
so looking at swiss cantons and their forms of organization can actually be informing when looking at how anarchists would react to things
"on the note of the swiss, interestingly, their form of government is a state, but it is on the more ""anarchist end of polcomp"" in terms of its organization. you had people like Thomas Jefferson distancing themselves from the ""anarchic Swiss people"" when trying to come up with a way to structure the US"
"there can exist an army under anarchism, it'd have to be directly accountable by the people"
Switzerland specifically has a bunch of mountains and goes to violent ends to enforce its neutrality
"i think it is possible, yeah. there's a lot more to this, especially when you consider that there exists a post-scarcity strain of anarchism that theoretically wants to meet everyone's desires"
give orders and provide needed organization if the project necessitates it
"i differentiate this from a hierarchy, which is a power structure where one group of people holds power over another (which is what you were talking about)"
"yeah like that, they are directly accountable to the people they ""represent"""
"sorta yeah, a social structure, which if utilized can yield a power greater than the sum of individual actors making up the structure"
see: the directly democratic factory committees. no one held power over anyone else within this power structure
i define a power structure to be an organized group of people (and the method in which they are organized). there doesn't have to be someone holding power over someone else under this definition
"as an example: soviet trade unions were hierarchical power structures (that eventually were absorbed into the bolshevik state apparatus), the directly democratic soviet factory committees were a non-hierarchical power structure (that Lenin initially supported but ended up being despised by him because they're less co-optable)"
"all hierarchies are power structures, not all power structures are hierarchies"
as long as the distinction between power structures and hierarchy is made
that i can agree with
"for more information on this topic i point to Graeber's ""Bullshit Jobs"""
which is a tad more difficult in the hierarchical schema of modern corporations
if a management position is unnecessary then you can just get rid of it
there's some difference
"looking specifically at the gathering of materials for a complex machine, trade would still be a thing (although i imagine the way in which trade is conducted would be different compared to today). looking at contemporary examples, some anarchist societies maintained an intermediary currency for trade (using either a local currency or labor vouchers or something else), others just traded supplies as needed between communes. 

as for the issue of production, you can organize w/o a top-down management system. get some people with skills, then they come up with a plan (they are the ones with skills after all), and then build the project. if looking at something very large scale (rocket or skyscraper), you can delegate a management position to make sure chaos doesn't ensue due to the un-human scale of things, though this management position will be beholden ultimately to the workers that are working on the project."

* Ideas for bypassing not being paid:
- Company doesn't get finished product, just prototype to see if it'd work
- Use a different but similar dataset
- Broaden scope beyond the data
- Could also just deal with general unsupervised categories
- Recommendation model to suggest new product (have customer data to do this)
* Also there's the option of just doing NLP (fake news/political bias detector using twitter data)

"to look at baboons, they are a prime example of why i said a hierarchy must be institutionalized. if there were a hypothetical hierarchy, the death of a few organisms at the top would not topple that hierarchy (see: racism, patriarchy, etc. there are institutions, laws, and cultures in place that place one group of people above another, such that even with the death of a few people at the top those hierarchies remain in place. this is because there are greater social powers enforcing these social relations). i have linked a case study of a baboon tribe where their ""hierarchy"" was observed. due to outside causes, all the ""alpha"" baboons unexpectedly died. then, rather than creating a new ""hierarchy"" where some ""beta"" baboons became the new alphas, they instead became a much more egalitarian community where the baboons would groom each other and treat each other well (this was not the case when the ""alphas"" were there). after returning to the tribe a couple decades later, this same behavior was observed of the tribe. this all happened because there was no general social bond that enforced this ""hierarchy,"" there were no institutions to enforce it. the animal is unable to conceive it

https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20040413tuesday.html"
"i believe there is a difference of definition at play here, i would like to see your variation of it (the one i will use, honoring your wish of excluding the explicit mention of institutions and ideology, is ""system of command and obedience in which elites enjoy varying degrees of control over subordinates""). 

now, this distinction between ""organized hierarchy"" and ""hierarchy"" is precisely what i was getting at, although i was referring to the former as simply ""hierarchy"" and the latter as something else. i agree that there exist various patricentric communities (in animals and humans alike) that create power imbalance within those communities, however that does not necessarily create hierarchy. per the definition i laid out, there has to be a system of command and obedience, but in almost all those cases there is no such system, it's mostly animals trying to survive. they're not trying to dominate each other, but rather are just trying to keep themselves fed (though i will note ""keeping themselves fed"" can be accomplished through competition or cooperation). 

in the case of bees, for example, the queen is unaware that she is a queen (monarchy is a concept people came up with that utilized institutions only people are capable of conceiving, after all). a beehive's purpose is largely reproductive, and the ""division of labor"" within it is purely to serve the hive's function of producing more bees, there is no authentic economic function anywhere in there. they're not trying to command/dominate each other."
"by its very definition, hierarchy is an *institutionalized* and *ideological* system of obedience/command. following from this observation, and from the additional observation that humanity is more or less the only organism we know of that has the ability and mental complexity to set up such institutions (the creation of which would require a greater social bond than simply one of ""i will eat you to survive"" or ""we'll survive better working together"" [although this does end up forming the basis for these greater bonds]), it is incredibly difficult to justify its existence anywhere else. applying this concept to animals (such as a carnivore that eats a herbivore) would divest hierarchy of its inherently social character (a carnivore does not seek to dominate its prey and exploit them as a person would do to another person, it simply wants to eat). true, it is not an invention, but rather a unique human development.

furthermore, to divest science of any social character would be gravely erroneous. to take nuclear weapons, for example, we made these weapons explicitly because the state, a hierarchical power structure, pooled together the resources needed to make them so it could use them to have power over another state. it then proceeded to use these weapons, despite the objections of much of military high command and most/all the scientists in charge of making these weapons.

apologies for the slightly cryptic phrasing (especially in the first paragraph), but i'm a tad busy doing other things to put this in layman's terms üòÖ"

Chainer‚Äôs edict is pretty nice
"Assuming there are 4 of them, each is $2.5, so that‚Äôs $10"
Wtf is [[astral cornucopia]] doing in a pauper deck

yes there‚Äôs cedh
Ghostly flicker is pretty good mana sink
But can never cast it
So you can have dryad arbor as a commander
You have to cast your commander
"It‚Äôs not objective at this point, I think"
"2 mana, in best color combo, tutor on a stick"
[[disciple of deceit]] is the objectively most powerful commander in this format
The cPDH tables are generally some sort of combo/control
But the games get a bit more diverse and fun a couple tiers down
At top tier tables at least
I don‚Äôt think midrange is Grindy enough to describe it
99 commons and an uncommon commander
It‚Äôs 100-card Singleton

"Solid blocker, 2 mana, card advantage"
Strix is a fun commander
"The hard thing with pdh is ""Why play it when edh exists"""
Any particular uncommon you‚Äôre excited to build around?
The rest of the deck is all commons
The commander has to be an uncommon
Ascended lawmage should be good
Disciple is top tier

Yeah we got a bunch of resources
Unfortunately the top of the meta consists of powerful blue decks
"tutor on a stick is good, as it turns out"
"yeah, disciple allows a ton of consistency with your deck, allowing you to assemble combos and just sculpt your hand into what it needs to be"
"1 color sucks, but people have toyed around with a turbo self-mill strategy"
I think enigma drake and some good control commanders are on it as well
don't recall anyhting else

it has a watchlist though
no banlist

What beachball?
Its color identity is 5c
"No, it works"
What we do is we play [[liquimetal coating]] and then do something afterwards
I had a great idea for this guy in edh
which is guaranteed in cpdh
except for those bois that play disciple
some ramp is usually alright because your opponents probably won't be breaking the game during the first couple turns
sphere and locket seem dec 3-mana bois
I'm fine with signet and bauble (because trinket mage) because they let you drake turn 3

too much ramp imo
just do control things

Here ya go in case you wanna get into the format: https://discord.gg/xfECdf
"The combo is pretty strong due to its natural synergy with flicker cards, which are really good in this format"
so feel free to play drake combo while that's not banned
the format's too small for one
not at the moment
also feel free to play high tide and hymn in addition to chainer's just because you can
I'm a sucker for etb effects...
"[[baleful strix]], for example"

"Don‚Äôt worry, the statement was directed at the gentleman in the hat"

rhystic study is where it's at
Aim for the long game rather than the short term gains of 1-time effects
It's not that good in pdh
"Creatures are weak as is, y u raise the total"

as I was saying

https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rulestips/2012/09/how-the-commander-tax-works-in-edhcommander/
Do you cast it?
Does lightning mare use the stack?
This is a major thing when you can't cast your commander
Commander tax is a cost that must be payed in addition to the cost of casting the commander

"But since the format isn't really sanctioned and there really isn't anything we can do about you wanting to play dryad arbor, feel free <@256543512164564995>"

"Back to gushing over the Esper pw. +1 is great in top of library matters, -1 is great in edh in general. Being able to reuse etb effects is one of the most powerful things you can do in edh. The ultimate is trash, but why would we use it?"
"Still, we have a bunch of cards left to spoil"
Me sees
Oh
That's a lot of mythics
Really? 3 more?!
We still have around 80-90% of the decks to spoil
Not the entire theme
Just add 10 cards that support a backup archetype
I believe wotc is doing something similar to what they did with wizards
They're all jund <:Kappa:230183873097629696>
"You do realize that we only have 5-10 cards from each deck, right?"
?
"In a top of library matters deck, the +1 is amazing. Not cedh, but great"
It's on a 3 mana pw

I like the pw...
Top of library matters doesn't seem too flavorful...

Is Shana a good replacement?
"Also they're both humans, which matters in this tribal-heavy format <:Kappa:230183873097629696>"

He‚Äôs representative of an era that these guys are familiar with
Also yeah that thing
The name recognition thing is reinforced by the fact that most of Biden‚Äôs supporters have Bernie as their second choice
Name recognition is a powerful thing
">Obama was a good President
>Biden served as vp under Obama
>Biden must be as good as Obama"
Exactly that
He‚Äôs got default support from the apolitical
Steyer doesn‚Äôt have a chance
"Eh, Biden has slowly been crumbling, Pete is finally dipping down, Warren is down, idk wtf Klob is doing"
He‚Äôs seen as more of a threat than the centrist candidates even though he barely made the debate
"From the Bernie crowd‚Äôs perspective, the centrist candidates are laughably bad and corrupt, so they don‚Äôt care for them as much as someone like Yang who can‚Äôt be categorized as a centrist"
And those tend to have a lot more hostility towards the other candidates
And then there are the hardcore Bernie/Yang/Tulsi/Kamala (idk how but those existed) supporters
There‚Äôs the #NeverBernie crowd
I‚Äôm guessing certain candidates tend to get under people‚Äôs skin a lot more

I was just explaining why I disagreed with UBI
"Not hyper-inflation levels, but a noticable bit"
"iirc, Alaska's UBI caused its prices to go up a bit"
"Rent is a slightly weaker argument imo (gotta present evidence and such, which I'm too lazy to do), but the issue of overall price increases (rent being the major part) will be a thing"
While the welfare people will end up netting $1k-whatever they were earning off welfare
The middle class will enjoy the net gain of the full $1k
The net that you would end up earning would be less than $1k
And while I do concede that point
This is usually countered by the argument that $1k a month is more than whatever you were receiving off those programs
There are a bunch of welfare programs that will be excluded if you choose to take UBI
Specifically UBI?
Also his support of a public option
I dislike his implementation of UBI
He might be a true representative of the American people

"Cacio e pepe is a pasta dish from modern Roman cuisine. ""Cacio e Pepe"" means ""cheese and pepper"" in several central Italian dialects. As the name suggests, the ingredients of the dish are very simple and include only black pepper, Pecorino Romano cheese, and pasta."
But that would be on them
"The tax, on the other hand, will have to pass through Congress"
"Not sure if it's that specific secretary, but you don't need congress to cancel it"
Secretary of Treasury (I believe) can just sign off all the debt
You don't need Congress in order to cancel student loan debt

Yang is a good candidate. The only one aside from Bernie I trust
For sure. The time he got to speak at the debates put him in a very good light
"True he has more than UBI, but that is his big thing"
"So I might be a conspiracy theorist on this one, but I think the end bill will have nuclear"
It's a very powerful bargaining tool since the majority of the populace support it
But I think it's best that be left off until the bill is introduced to legislation
There's criticism to be made about the lack of nuclear energy

"Not to mention he has the most diverse coalition, which is a key part in winning an election"
"And is popular in the rust belt, which Hillary lost and as a result also lost the election"
He beats Trump in the vast majority of current polling
Both in shifting the Overton window and in implementing his more doable policies
He can get a lot done in his first term though
Yeah I can agree with that
UBI is a policy that deserves to be discussed and developed. I don‚Äôt really like its current iteration
Yang is an interesting candidate with an interesting proposal
"Warren, on the other hand... they‚Äôve been giving her millions of dollars worth of exposure for several months now"

So there‚Äôs a separate database for storing decklists? Neato
Is the deck plugged through goldfish/tappedout?
So I can plug in a deck and say a success is 1-2 tortex and 2-3 lands?
Does this hand command measure the amount of lands drawn or what?
I would probably put it under statistics since the draw hand commands probably refer to drawing a hand instead of analyzing a bunch of hands
Are statistic commands under graph?

"In the end, yeah, everyone has their beliefs and ideas of fun"
"I believe there is merit to both paper and online play. Paper play will usually be superior due to the social aspect, but online has a lot more convenience.

Where 3 and 4 don‚Äôt apply as much
I think agent was discussing a more casual lgs paper experience
It‚Äôs mostly about whether you prefer convenience of online or the social aspect provided by paper
"We need a proof of residence and a bunch of other documents which take a really long time to process and if you‚Äôre getting a permit, you gotta take the exam too.

"and we can much more easily show that 1/x and -1/x go to 0 , so sin(x)/x would also have to be going to 0 according to the squeeze theorem"
and we can squeeze sin(x)/x between them
"and greater than -1/x, for example"
"sin(x)/x is always going to be less than or equal to 1/x, for example"
"I dunno how they teach you, but I would use the squeeze theorem and apply the epsilon delta definition to the equations I get out of that"
since it doesn't decrease all the time
"it gets more interesting with trig functions, such as sin(x)/x"
"and because we know that the function is going to be decreasing after that point, it implies that all values of f(x) after x=100 are going to be within the range of 0.01"
because 1/100 is going to be within 0.01
the first instance of this is at x=100
and then we find a point that's within 0.01 of the limit
"so we take a very small number, again 0.01"
we wanna show that the limit goes to 0
"for example, lets take 1/x"
the easiest way of doing this is to find if the function converges
then we gotta show that there exists a point after which all points have a y-value that's within 0.01 of the limit
"let's take 0.01, for example"
"alright, so what you want to do is take a very small number"
"I mean, epsilon delta is used to define a limit, not to prove the definition of a limit"
I assume to prove something

Only 2 murderous rider and 1 Kalitas though
Will be assembling the deck once back on campus
Rally zombies came today
"The majority, if I'm not mistaken"

[[return to the ranks]] is similar
<@!212187960173527041> really considering adding rally to wb zombies
"So we have some sort of esper deck, mayhaps <:thinkwalla:545253564394504192>"
Sounds bueno
<@!212187960173527041> I assume you have something like [[nantuko husk]] to get rid of your zombies before they get exiled next upkeep
[[rally the ancestors]]
"Looking at it from another angle, you‚Äôre paying $11 for a piece of cardboard"
"So yes, you can kill your permanent in response"

Fair <@!145964000688078849>
That sounds gas
[[brion]]?
Which isn‚Äôt saying much
For boros it‚Äôs pretty good
With multiple combat steps it becomes pretty good
"My preferred boros commander is [[!adriana captain]], mostly because the art is amazing"
"1/3, no?"
They‚Äôre 2-drops
"Not as good of topdecks of course, buuut"
Corpse knight and wayward servant are 2 drops that make fine impressions of Gary
The build focuses on token production instead of Gary shenanigans
https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/25-11-19-wb-zombie-tokens/
"One is card advantage and a token producer, other is a more efficient token producer and a giant beater"
"Probably cryptbreaker, but it‚Äôs close"
First is either cryptbreaker or diregraf colossus
That guy is in my top 2 favorite zombies
And the 1 thoughtseize I need to complete the playset
Heckin mana base is pricy
Making wb zombies in pioneer
There's a reason it's banned
Hymn isn't that fun to play against
Why's that a problem?
"Modern is much faster, so snappy's ability to be instant speed and getting flashback right away is more valuable"
"Legacy is a slower format, so you'll be able to get more use out of arcanist"
Lemme <:thinkwalla:545253564394504192>
Actually idk
and bolts
Legacy you get cantrips
I assume modern delver has much fewer good 1-mana plays
Also flashback is free
Interesting <:thinkwalla:545253564394504192>

Card seems dec üëå
Potential combat damage shenanigans
"Synergy with jtms, bob, bitterblossom"
Liking time warp more and more in this deck
ooh yah
Build would still look a bit iffy imo
Which is something
It's also a mana drain
"mystical is a fof, a boardwipe, targetted removal"
"Control will want mystical tutor, downfall, damnation and wurm"
Shinobi a massacre wurm <:blingwalla:559184849261297675>
[[fallen shenobi]]
Looking into a possible control strategy...
Mystical tutor into FoF could be legit <:thinkwalla:545253564394504192>
[[hypnotic specter]]
hmm
Good thing about image is that it's 2 mana to copy the best thing on the table
Don't think thing is going off anytime soon
You have 8 instants/sorceries
Venser is a good tempo card
Ended up taking 5 with a scarab god
Played against a guy who got both Bob and Bitterblossom out
Speaking of confidant
Yah

omg
My deck forced the opponent to mul to 4 <:rootwalla:514073586407964703>
ez
Just won the game turn 0
recall the opponent <:rootwalla:514073586407964703>
opponent is apparently 5c storm
welp
might be dead
oh there's a yawg's will
Mill 6

no
my opponent just brain freezeed on storm 2
let me just swing with my tyrant
ffs
my opponent has been JTMS'ing for 3 minute now
According to rule 3 no nsfw images
o nononono
but I'm not in the position to be playing a big brain deck
same
And I'm over here dropping carnage tyrant
My opponent just doing fancy stuff with JTMS
Sultai goodstuff is pretty dec
Garruk relentless + Master of the wild hunt
Magic is ez
Vintage cube is pretty nutty
because I got all the mono g cards
seems like someone else has been forcing storm
It's basically a bolt when opponent has 2 cards left in library <:rootwalla:514073586407964703>

Ok boomer
Green ramp? More like devastated ramp amirite?
Run your control opponents‚Äô clocks out by tapping and untapping your basalt monoliths <:rootwalla:514073586407964703>
Yeah makes sense
Go infinite really easily with ashnod's altar
3 mana reanimate every turn doesn‚Äôt seem too shabby
It‚Äôs value in black commander decks
<:rootwalla:514073586407964703>
Ok boomer
It definitely gets an upgrade
0-mana +8/+8 seems pretty dec
Exalted is pretty good in this deck
"Both pairs of boots, whisper silk cloak"
I‚Äôd probably want a combination of group hug and protection for Grunn
Do you have a list?
<:rootwalla:514073586407964703>
Can't have any backlash from a player if they're dead
Which commander <@!120225052041019392> ?
<:thinkwalla:545253564394504192>
[[skeleton ship]]
"1. Get astrolabe
2. Get glint hawk
3. Profit because you just spent 50% the mana"
Way more balanced than the astrolabe bs that happened some time ago
Then you‚Äôll have 2/3 of a deck
Just mash them together
A colorless 0-mana 3/3 that draws a card
Of course
"2WU draw 6, gain a 2/2"
<:drifter:521697436322758676> is not a joke to me
Skyfisher was the best creature literally 2 weeks ago

Let‚Äôs wait a week or 2 and see if the format converges
So many possibilities
But I might be a bit biased
Zombies could be interesting. Pioneer has a bit of zombie tribal support
Assuming 3 opponents
It would trigger 3 times in edh
Just goldfish a bunch at home or something to get used to the motions
"Lantern though, if you can play it at a good enough speed, would be alright imo"
Ugh
But wu control just gets to me

Little Red Riding Hood
Did not expect to see it in legacy
Saw it in modern
üêê ü§ñ
<:rootwalla:514073586407964703>
I just remember it from that one meme explaining the complexity of legality in standard
[[rampaging ferocidon]] is still banned
"Like, bridge isn‚Äôt even a magic card"
It being a new card makes me less inclined that they‚Äôll ban it
"Predictions: 
Modern: bridge and looting
Everything else: no changes"
And in modern people were also complaining about the addition of more planeswalkers
I think people were complaining about lands in legacy
Yah
Other than that the format is pretty slow
It was disgusting
Turn 5 inspiring captain
Turn 4 hawk that gets +1/+1 when a boi etb's
Turn 3 3/2 that gives a +1/+1 counter on death
Turn 2 the 2/2 that gives itself first strike
Turn 1 shock
Game 2
Round 3 was playing against boros
Now lemme tell you something
Is it though?
"Ah yes, the classical RG lands archetype"
Pacifism on rotting regisaur is brutal
Speaking of removal
It's amazing removal
Was the black splash was for murder?
To sorta help with the board stalls
But luckily we got that elemental that gives elementals trample at common
The lack of trample on vorstclaw is a small problem
So you weren't trying to win via natural mill?
Please do elaborate

Yeah seeing cryptbreaker in legacy is really nice
Legacy version looks similar?
Which you sac and mill your opponent‚Äôs entire library
Then you‚Äôll have a billion zombies
Rinse and repeat until library is in graveyard
Recast hogaak
We tap zombies to convoke and delve some more away
And mill 8
We make 2 zombies from bridges
We sac hogaak targeting ourselves
We delve away some stuff to cast hogaak
"But modern version goes something like this: we have altar of dementia and then 2 bridge from below and hogaak in graveyard, as well as a couple bodies"
Not sure about legacy version
On the other you can infinitely mill your opponent
On one hand you got a beatdown strategy with hogaak and vengevine with a bunch of discard and self mill
They kill pretty quickly
Play all the 1-drops
Edric is pretty nutty

"If possible, I would try and find a 4th or 5th player, but 3 players should still be fun"
"if there is unbalance, it'll turn into a 2v1 very quickly and become unfun for the person with the more powerful deck"
<@142388511943688192> 3 player commander should be fine as long as the decks are balanced

"""I can kill your threats easily, it'll just take me a very long time to kill you"""

They look like custom cards tbh

"<@!274259510074408960> I remember there was a trivia episode of Friday nights, although everyone probably knows those now"
Mono u looks pretty appealing
I can imagine a grenzo deck that takes advantage of the new mull rule
And still have 7 cards to find bazaar
Lol you can mill down to 1
or even limited
I would love to just witness what that would do to standard
They'll probably make Tibalt a common
The magic sub is trying to see what all the pw‚Äôs are
Comments said he missed some stuff
That post was great
Hmm... a car or a vintage deck ü§î
It‚Äôs mostly maintaining priority
And zuberas are an in-depth on the stack
Tireless tribe is an intro to layering
I don‚Äôt think so

"Umm... don‚Äôt think so, but we know all the pauper interactions pretty well"
Pretty bad v uninteractive decks though

Stay tuned
We got some ideas for rootwalla emojis
"I said they would increase after the year ends (11 months), when the stream of supply gets dried up"
sorry <@227882735186870272> for some reason it wasn't showing any activity in <#217712787357433856>
After this year is when those premium bolt arts will go up in value
"I‚Äôm not an economics expert, but the price should be relatively stable this year <@227882735186870272> due to somewhat of a supply flow"
Early March
Ptq is at gp Angeles
Yeah bolt is the 2019 promo
I know it‚Äôs at least the promo for the pauper ptq
<:rootwalla:514073586407964703>
That idea seems flawed
Plan b... umm... bash with 1/1‚Äôs
"Crap, there goes my plan for ensnaring bridge"
What‚Äôs the pridemate change?
With invert people would have to remember it for possibly many turns and there were more chances that layering gets involved
How good is the electrodomimance deck? Seems like a fragile pile

No Zambies though
Snek was also a nice card
"One of the more fun ones, that is"
That card was one of the better energy cards
Energy bob
Bob?
It just left a really bad taste in my mouth
I guess kaladesh would be alright in a format like arena+ given enough sets
Stony silence ü§î
The storm version was pretty fun
"Yeah, marvel seems less busted without titans"
And the creatures were decent even without energy
And ability to play 3 colors
And marvel
I just don‚Äôt wanna deal with energy again
Amonkhet has a bunch of sweet stuff
Amonkhet and up please
But I really don‚Äôt wanna go back to that block of evil
Since that was in arena for a bit
People think arena+ will go all the way back to kaladesh
Captive audience‚Äôs art is so good
That's sick
That would've been gas
Are you playing the toughness damage thing?
"not a value play, but seems very dec"
that's like 10 damage right there
because you got the goblin token makers in red and all the afterlife stuff in white
makes a boros deck very viable in this limited set
can win the game with all the afterlife tokens
burn bright is a fine card
it was so satisfying
just try to accumulate as much value as possible and make as many tokens
In the mirror the match felt like a pauper deck
My first grindy midrange deck was selesnya at guilds prerelease
gruul+rakdos?
you get the best removal plus the cross synergies between dying and stuff
"yeah, mardu just seems like the best color combo"
Turns out any prerelease deck can be good given enough removal
I went 3-0 with a mardu pile
I would assume limited
Gl!
just make sure to not fight a deathtoucher hehe
whereas removal can destroy key cards from the opponent such as deathtouchers that would be difficullt for your deck to deal with
By combat tricks I meant pump and stuff like that becomes less useful
You still want removal though
Also your combat tricks are much worse because you‚Äôll usually win combat
The way I‚Äôm looking at it is low drops that don‚Äôt ramp will be pretty useless to you once you get into fatty range
Maakas are meh
Ramp is great
"Also I suggest you play the locket, even though it‚Äôs rakdos"
"That‚Äôs more of a rakdos card, where you just want spectacle online as easily as possible"
Tin street dodger goes against your strategy of ramping into fatties
"I mean, the deck used to run divest"
Could be interesting in ubxd
As long as the admins don‚Äôt find out...
<#511724507191312404> conversation guys
But not in aggro
Agreed
But that would mean taking out aggro cards üò≠
Mbm?
Which decks are we looking at?
Though the spiciness is üëå
5 mana is a bit problematic
That‚Äôs a spicy combo. Image giving the thing it‚Äôs copying illusion completely mitigates the downside

"Anywho, I‚Äôm supposed to be asleep now"
Rtr is goood
I‚Äôm lucky to be with a strong pauper scene that includes <@199862715089420288> and <@405915958939615243> . I hope I‚Äôll be able to attend at least 1 event during winter vacation!
"True that, agent"
Aaannd another thing: you can post your town/city in r/pauper asking if there are pauper events nearby. Chances are you‚Äôll hit someone if there is an event going on around your area
"A thing before I üí§ : ask around if stores are doing pauper events, because you WILL NOT find pauper events on the mtg store locator due to it not being a sanctioned format. The only way of knowing if a store is doing events is to ask around there or to check their website"
"Anywho, I gotta go to sleep. Gotta be up for classes in 5.5 hours. Will try and make the dragon deck sometime tomorrow"
Yeah don‚Äôt cross-pollinate formats unless your entire deck is legal in the other format or unless you‚Äôre doing it casually
Modern on the other hand is a tad too strong for commons
The card pools are waaay different
"Pauper‚Äôs power level is probably on par with standard, though people will be against you playing a deck from another format in a sanctioned event"
"Though as I already stated, pauper isn‚Äôt as popular at local game stores, so if you want to play there, you‚Äôll most likely have to do standard or modern"
And the deck is just built around getting each of these lands and then playing big things
You can get 7 mana on turn 3 if you assemble each of the ‚Äútron lands‚Äù
And this is a big-creature deck: http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=20425&d=333811
"The deck may look expensive, but that‚Äôs because it has 3 of a $30 common, so if you switch those out you‚Äôll have a $60 deck"
Mono b: http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=20425&d=333805&f=PAU
The budget depends on the format and whether you want to be competitive or not
Plus many of the decks are <$100
"Though if you do have a limited budget, I would recommend you look into pauper. It has an established mono B deck and ways of playing huge creatures"
Nah it‚Äôs good. I like making decks
"I‚Äôll see what I can do about a decklist, but mono b should be easy enough to find"
"There‚Äôs a concept called ‚Äúmatchups,‚Äù which are basically percentages on how likely you‚Äôre to win against certain decks"
You have your losses with every deck
It can be upwards $2400
Modern is an expensive format
Unless you have a budget in mind
I‚Äôll try to make the list as cheap as possible and then add a list of cards that can be added as upgrades
"<@519344994734047233> I can probably make a rough dragon list for you, but I gotta get a budget"
"I think a friend of mine made a dragon deck a bit back. Might get the list somehow. How much of a concern is budget <@519344994734047233> , because modern can be very expensive"
That‚Äôs definitely the cheapest ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù option
https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/budget-magic-88-50-tix-mono-green-devotion-modern seems like an alright starting point
Hmm... I think there‚Äôs a decent mono g ramp deck in modern?
Which format are we looking at? Just some casual decks?
"Drafting develops a lot of key skills, like identifying which cards are good, reading the table, deckbuilding, also just learning about mechanics and cards"
Best thing to do would probably start drafting and see which formats your stores support
Also golgari cards are goood
Planeswalker decks are pretty good against each other
"You get 2 starter decks in a kit, so either you have 2 30-card decks that can play against each other or you can combine them into a 60-card deck"
<@232813973341208577> that is true
"The downside though is that pauper doesn‚Äôt really get that much support in local game stores, so you have to look really hard to find a crowd"
"Or you could try getting into pauper. You got an entire discord to learn from, plus commons are the simplest form of magic, while also being some of the most complicated ones once you grasp the key concepts of magic"
"I would suggest you start with a less complicated format. Drafting standard legal sets is really helpful, the easiest constructed format to get into is standard due to its support in every local game store, so you‚Äôll likely find someone willing to teach you about the new mechanics and how decks work"
(Please ignore the fact that I‚Äôm half an hour late with the message)

Not deck variety
I meant opening hands
"Welp, got a flight. T‚Äôwas an insightful conversation."
Actually it‚Äôs closer to 10%
"So an ideal play does exist, but it‚Äôs more difficult to find?"
Or rather a select few?
But would there usually be an ideal line of play?
Of course
I meant the choosing of spells
"If you played against the same deck twice, would you have the same strategy and sequence of drawing both times?"
"The same can be said about magic, except some of the matchups seem to be more polarizing here, where some decks cannot beat another"
"Yeah, since magic can‚Äôt really errata (except for a few exceptions such as hostage taker, which could initially cause a loop with itself), the more op cards are left to their own devices, but usually aren‚Äôt powerful enough to warrant a ban since those cards generally have a deck they‚Äôre weak against"
Yeah
"This type of balancing does make for a more balanced game because it allows for a company to fix their mistakes, obviously"
And in what fashion did they fix the old cards? Just print them again with the new rules change and say that‚Äôs the official ruling?
"From looking at mage wars for a bit, they made erratas to balance the game‚Äôs cards."
"It‚Äôs alright, you got an excuse"
Since you won‚Äôt actually be seeing any new cards by mulling from 1 to 0
"But if you keep 1 card, you‚Äôll have more chances of scrying and drawing into bazaar"
I dunno. You‚Äôre only playing like 2 copies of each
[[maze‚Äôs end]]

There‚Äôs that new thing from guilds

Even then settle the wreckage is something you have to worry about from wu
"But yeah, many mtg decks rely more heavily on variance, not just ‚Äúdiscard at random‚Äù hollow one stuff. Stuff like bagels can also be described to be more rng-based"
It‚Äôs a secret though
For 3 mana
It counters a non creature spell
But they have C O U N T E R S P E L L
"When compared to mtg, hs doesn‚Äôt require as much skill, true"
To support a specific lifestyle
The errata will help a lot to prevent stuff like this from happening
Many will not realize that its ability will give +0/+2 even after casting invert
Umm... just know it has firebreathing x2
"The fire breathing gobbo boi and invert, for example"
It‚Äôs going to help with layering a lot
"Since the card is worse now, can it be a common?"

Just create a separate match where you do vinestorm v vinestorm if you make it to the finals and then the loser of that concedes

The blue cantrips were nuked into oblivion though
You think Goblin guide is good? Hah!

Golver

Gelver
Stelver?
[[Flying carpet]] delver?
Carpet delver?
But delver isn't in the name though. We all know we stick delver in the name even when it's the worst creature
So it's not a delver deck
The deck doesn't have delver in its name
Close enough
So pauper will be the safe haven of yet another card?
You don't need them underground seas
Budget deck
I would also like to see a semi fair deck go up against its more unfair counterpart
Life from the loam cannot die! It will never die!
"also yeah, the deck is expensive üòõ"

"Whereas mtgo allows you to play all the formats. Not as shiny, but more complicated. Best for players who just want to grind and play more magic"

yeah. Play with the top card of your libraary revealed should probably be a thing
"""Spells you cast that share a permanent type with the card on top of your library cost 1 less to cast?"" Gotta make it look more like a book"
It's a work in progress
"""i was sort of imagining an artifact that does stuff based on what's on top""
^^^^"
5 books seems alright
i was sort of imagining an artifact that does stuff based on what's on top
"This isn't a standard set. If it was standard, they would probably not do it, but since it isn't, I think there's a possibility. I mean, permanent types are a theme in the 3 other decks, so why shouldn't the 4th be somewhat similar?"
because library and it interacts with it
imo they'll make a sub-type of artifact called book
Which is why I think there'll be a new permanent/sub-type in that deck
the only one not representing one being top of library matters
I noticed that 3 of the 4 decks are about permanent types
top of library matters seems lit

First edh spoiler,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/217712787357433856/470670943048433684/geodegolem.png
we should probably move to <#189191356479045632>
Or you can use [[sparksmith]] and [[death spark]] in order to grind the game out
You can either go hyper-aggro all over your opponent
"As I said, there are 2 plans to this"
17 mountains?
"4 foundry street denizen
4 goblin bushwhacker
4 goblin cohort
4 mogg conscripts
4 goblin sledder
4 mogg raider
4 lightning bolt
4 goblin instigator (try this guy out. Seems great in goblins)
4 mogg war marshall
3 sparksmith
1 goblin matron
1 fireblast
2 needle drop"
Let's see if I can come up with a stock list...
Also you can probably cut a couple lands from the main deck since pretty much everything there costs 1
You can probably take out the razes. They're pretty bad
[[raze]]
[[pyroblast]] is the best sideboard card in pauper at the moment
cheap
[[$sparksmith]]
Sparksmith is soooo good
replace 3 of them with sparksmith
goblin matron
Also I don't recommend playing so many matrons. Conflicts with the gameplan of winning asap
where da pyroblasts at?
<@311511677021585408> there's multiple gb dredge lists. Either [[tortured existence]] lists or morbid (like saffron olive did) or just straight up delve
either you go super aggro like goblins usually do or you generate lots of value with [[sparksmith]]
"gobbos were around $30 last time I checked, I think. It's great because you have 2 ways of playing it"

"Augur is currently played in various UB control decks and delver strategies. Its ban would mean UB control decks would take a hit (not a very good thing) but should survive off other CA cards and <:drifter:371465716081098755> . Delver on the other hand will also take a massive hit, since it plays 4 copies (and we're looking to nerf delver decks, it seems). Augur is a blue card that protects the deck against aggro's early game, and blue shouldn't have access to that. Augur's ban will allow for aggro decks that play x-1 creatures to repopulate the meta since augur is the only card really keeping it back. Trickery is fine, but to have a 4-of answer to most of the creatures that those decks play in the main deck is just wrong"
